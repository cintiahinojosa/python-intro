Programming is a way of communicating with the computer. You give your *orders* to a computer via a programming language and the computer understands your orders and execute them.

Depending on what you want to do (e.g., writing a code to solve a partial equation, creating a user interface, writing a computer game, etc.), you need to select an appropriate language. Each programming language has its own syntax that programmers should respect. 

[Python](http://www.python.org) is a popular programming languages with easy to understand syntax and good community support.
